## Description
    
The goal of this project is to create a review board for anime with individual user profiles and future recommendations based on the level of engagement with a particular intellectual property. There will be a sign-up page, a login page, a profile page, and a trending page. The trending page will be accessible to anyone irrespective of having a user profile but will be read-only unless the individual has one. Users will see a text box between the anime cover art icon and the review list where they can write their thoughts and have the option of posting via a submit button that, on click, will append the user’s new review to the top of the review list. The profile pge will have all of the usaer’s previous reviews in order starting with their most recent review. Users will also have the option of editing previous reviews on their profile page.
